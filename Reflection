I began by asking chatGPT for a large template of a basic idea of the CSS. I then spent around 30-45 minutes redesigning colors, fonts, and formatting. One issue I encountered was the formatting of the bottom table. For some reason, it kept on panning to the left and wouldn't center. I finally fixed it by adding an actual field that centered the table and made it reach both edges of the screen. Another issue I encountered was the formatting of the quiz field. After about 20 minutes of trying to get the text boxes to align to the right, I gave up. I tried the same thing I used for the table but it did not work to get the right side alignment.
